Mess Master is a Flutter application designed for mess owners who currently manage their operations using a pen-and-paper system. The app features a simple and intuitive user interface that mirrors the traditional mess register, making it easy for mess owners to transition to digital management.

## Tech stack
* Flutter
* Firebase

## Features
#### 1. Expense tracker
   
An expense tracker is provided to allow the mess owner to keep track of their business income and expenditure which is displayed using intuitive graphs. 

#### 2. Member entry table

The member entry table mirrors the traditional mess register and contains the required columns like name, contact number, registration date, expiry date etc. for storing client information.

#### 3. Automatic expiry date calculation

With the pen-and-paper system, mess owners must manually calculate the expiry dates of clients' subscriptions based on their chosen plans. The app simplifies this process by automatically calculating the subscription expiry dates for the mess owner's convenience.

#### 4. Data sorting

The member entry table allows sorting on the basis of name and registration date for convenience, which is challenging to achieve using the pen-and-paper system.

#### 5. Subscription expiry notifications

With the pen-and-paper system, mess owners must manually track plans that are about to expire to notify the respective clients. The app streamlines this process by automatically displaying plans that have expired and those that are nearing their expiry dates.

#### 6. SMS notifications

Once a client's plan expires, the app enables the mess owner to send an SMS notification to the respective client about the plan's expiry.

#### 7. Multi-language support (Hindi, Marathi, English (default))

The app supports multiple languages like Hindi, Marathi and English for increased accessibility.
